## Description
Fitness Time is a very basic single page web application at this point, that utilized a Rails API backend with postgresql database and a Javascript frontend, with so room for growth. A fitness studio, or in this case a dance studio, can add dance classes that get displayed on the page, can be edited, or deleted. 

## Installation
To initiate the API, clone this repository, change directories into /fitness_time_backend. Run `bundle install`, `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed` and then `rails s`. To see the API data navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/dance_classes, http://127.0.0.1:3000/teachers, http://127.0.0.1:3000/studios, and/or http://127.0.0.1:3000/levels.
## Use
From the frontend directory you can run `open index.html` to run the application
